This Java program enables you to rename files in a specified directory using a given base name and a numbering scheme. It verifies the directory's validity and iterates through the files, extracting the file extension and creating a new name using the base name, a three-digit numbering format, and the original file extension. The program attempts to rename each file accordingly and displays the outcome. This functionality is similar to the "Batch Rename" feature in the "Adobe Photoshop" software, particularly the "Raw Editor" mode, where you can achieve the same file renaming functionality.
